# Simple Chatbot

This is a simple chatbot created by Hamza Daoud for fun and learning purposes. The chatbot is implemented in C# and uses a basic Natural Language Understanding (NLU) system to classify user intents and respond accordingly.

## Getting Started

To get started with the chatbot, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/hamzadaoud/simpleChatbot.git


2. Build the project:
cd simpleChatbot
dotnet build

3. Run the chatbot:
dotnet run


## Usage

The chatbot understands various intents such as greetings, asking about its age, asking about itself, farewells, giving thanks, and more. You can chat with the bot by typing your messages in the console. Type 'exit' to quit the chat.

Example conversation:
Welcome to the Simple Chatbot!
You can start chatting. Type 'exit' to quit.

User: hello
Bot: Hello! Nice to meet you.

User: what's your favorite song?
Bot: Unfortunately, I can't play music, but I'm happy to discuss it with you!

User: goodbye
Bot: Goodbye! Have a great day!
